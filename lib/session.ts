/**
 * 🎓 SESSION CONFIGURATION
 * 
 * This file configures "iron-session" — a library that ENCRYPTS and SIGNS
 * cookies so nobody can tamper with them.
 * 
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * 1. When a user logs in, we store their session data (id, role, etc.)
 * 2. iron-session encrypts this data using SESSION_SECRET from .env
 * 3. The encrypted string is stored as a cookie
 * 4. When a request comes in, iron-session decrypts the cookie
 * 5. If someone tampered with it, decryption fails → session rejected
 * 
 * WHY NOT JWT?
 * JWTs are signed but NOT encrypted — anyone can READ the payload
 * (they just can't modify it). iron-session encrypts everything,
 * so nobody can even see what's inside the cookie.

 *           We read it from .env so it's never in source code.
 * 
 * cookieName: The name of the cookie stored in the browser.
 * 
 * cookieOptions:
 *   - httpOnly: Browser JavaScript can't read this cookie (prevents XSS theft)
 *   - secure: Only sent over HTTPS in production (prevents network sniffing)
 *   - sameSite: "lax" means the cookie is sent on navigation but not on
 *               cross-site POST requests (basic CSRF protection)
 *   - maxAge: Cookie expires after 7 days (in seconds: 7 × 24 × 60 × 60)
